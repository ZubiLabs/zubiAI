Should the chat interface have a specific look and feel, or will a basic design suffice for the MVP?\\n2. Do you require any specific features for message formatting, such as bold, italics, etc.?\\n3. Is there a need for user authentication in this chat interface, or is it open for anyone with the link to access?\\n\\nOnce these details are confirmed, I believe we will have all the necessary requirements to proceed."

I\'ll proceed with setting up a basic web-based chat interface that supports plain text communication with the REST API using placeholders for the endpoints. If any further questions arise or if we need to revisit any details, I\'ll reach out to you.\\n\\nI\'ll now work on compiling the requirements and will get back to you with the progress or if additional information is needed. Thank you for your input, and I\'ll be in touch soon."
